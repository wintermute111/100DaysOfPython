# Instructions
# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.
#
# It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.
#
# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.
#
#
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
#
# BMI = weight(kg) / height^2(m^2)
#
# Warning you should round the result to the nearest whole number. The interpretation message needs to include the
# words in bold from the interpretations above. e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.
#
# Example Input
# weight = 85
# height = 1.75
# Example Output
# 85 ÷ (1.75 x 1.75) = 27.755102040816325
# Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.
#
# The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:
#
# "Your BMI is 18, you are underweight."
# "Your BMI is 22, you have a normal weight."
# "Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight."
# "Your BMI is 33, you are obese."
# "Your BMI is 40, you are clinically obese."
# Hint
#
# Try to use the exponent operator in your code.
# Remember to round your result to the nearest whole number.
# Make sure you include the words in bold from the interpretations.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

# Write your code below this line 👇

bmi = int(round(weight / height ** 2, 0))

if bmi < 18.5:
    result = "are underweight."
elif bmi < 25:
    result = "have a normal weight."
elif bmi < 30:
    result = "are slightly overweight."
elif bmi < 35:
    result = "are obese."
else:
    result = "are clinically obese."

print(f"Your BMI is {bmi}, you {result}")
